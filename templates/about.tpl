        <h1>About {$site_name}</h1>
        <p>
            Electioneering is a high-stakes game. We, at {$site_name}, believe that itâ€™s time for that game to become a spectator sport.
        </p>
        <p>
            {$site_name} is a real-time election leaflet project. Our ambition is to create a live visualization of the flood of party political leaflets as they are delivered across the country during an election campaign.

            If you have recently received any election leaflets through your door you can help by photographing or scanning them and <a href="{$www_server}/addupload">uploading the images to our website</a>.

            This website was thrown together by John Handelaar, who's also responsible for <a href="http://www.kildarestreet.com">KildareStreet.com</a>. 
            It is almost entirely based on the efforts of the <a href="http://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au">OpenAustralia Foundation</a>'s fine volunteers:  Andrea Lau, Henare Degan, Jack Zhao, Katherine Szuminska,
            Lisa Cross, Matt Joyce, Matthew Landauer and Teresa Leung.  The Australian site, in turn, was adapted from the UK's <a href="http://www.thestraightchoice.org/about.php">TheStraightChoice.org</a> built by Julian Todd,
            Richard Pope and Francis Irving.
